避雷 Aiven 的免费套餐，发了2天邮件，然后就停了

<!--more-->

这是 free-for-dev 上的描述

```txt
Aiven - Aiven offers free PostgreSQL, MySQL and Redis plans on its open-source data platform.
Single node, 1 CPU, 1GB RAM, and for PostgreSQL and MySQL, 5GB storage.
Easy migration to more extensive plans or across clouds.
```

这是给我发的邮件

```txt
Log in to Aiven Console to keep your free service running
You haven't used Aiven for a while.

Free services are automatically powered off if they or the Aiven platform aren't actively used.
Log in to Aiven Console to keep your free services running.

To reduce your carbon footprint, you can also power off or delete services yourself at any time.
```

看时间应该是2周，数据库我是每天一直在读写的，然后2周不登录就给停了（比中指）。

网上介绍也没说，开数据库的时候也没说，又浪费了我周末的一天。
